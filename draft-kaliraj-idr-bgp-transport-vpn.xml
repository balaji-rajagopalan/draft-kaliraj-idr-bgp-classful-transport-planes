    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a mechanism, referred to as "service
      mapping", to express association of overlay routes with underlay routes
      using BGP. The document describes a framework for service mapping, and
      specifies BGP protocol procedures that enable dissimination of the
      service mapping information that can potentially cross administrative
      domains. It makes it possible to advertise multiple tunnels to the same
      destination. </t>

      <t>A new BGP transport address family is defined for this purpose that
      uses BGP-VPN technology (RFC 4364) and follows RLI-8277 NLRI encoding.
      This new address family is called "Transport VPN".</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>To facilitate service mapping, the tunnels in a network can be
      grouped by the purpose they serve into a "Transport Class". The tunnels
      could be created using any signaling protocol, such as LDP, RSVP, BGP-LU
      or SPRING. The tunnels could also use native IP or IPv6, as long as the
      tunnels can carry MPLS payload. Tunnels may exist between different pair
      of end points. Multiple tunnels may exist between the same pair of end
      points.</t>

      <t>Thus, a Transport Class consists of tunnels created by many protocols
      terminating in various nodes, each satisfying the properties of the
      class. For example, a "Gold" transport class may consist of tunnels that
      traverse the shortest path with fast re-route protection, a "Silver"
      transport class may hold tunnels that traverse shortest paths without
      protection, a "To NbrAS Foo" transport class may hold tunnels that exit
      to neighboring AS Foo, and so on.</t>

      <t>The extensions specified in this document can be used to create a BGP
      transport tunnel that potentially spans domains, while preserving its
      Transport Class. Examples of domain are Autonomous System (AS), or IGP
      area. Within each domain, there is a second level underlay LSP used by
      BGP to cross the domain. The second level underlay LSPs could be
      hetrogeneous: Each domain may use a different type of tunnel, or use a
      differnet signaling protocol. A domain boundary is demarcated by a
      rewrite of BGP nexthop to 'self' while re-advertising tunnel routes in
      BGP. The path uses MPLS label-switching when crossing inter-AS links and
      uses the native intra-AS tunnel of the desired traffic class when
      traversing within a domain.</t>

      <t>Overlay routes carry sufficient indication of the Transport Class
      they should be encapsulated over. A "route resolution" procedure on the
      ingress node selects from the Transport Class an appropriate tunnel
      whose destination matches the nexthop of the overlay route. If the
      overlay route is carried in BGP, the protocol nexthop (or, PNH) is
      generally carried as an attribute of the route. The PNH of the overlay
      route is also referred to as "service endpoint". The service endpoint
      may exist in the same domain as the service ingress node or lie in a
      different domain, adjacent or non-adjacent.</t>

      <t>This document describes mechanisms to: <list>
          <t>Model a "Transport Class" as "Transport RIB" on a router,
          consisting of tunnel ingress routes of a certain class.</t>

          <t>Enable service routes to resolve over an intended Transport Class
          by using the corresponding Transport RIB for finding nexthop
          reachability.</t>

          <t>Advertise tunnel ingress routes in a Transport RIB via BGP
          without any path hiding, using BGP VPN technology and Add-path. Such
          that overlay routes in the receiving domains can also resolve over
          tunnels of associated Transport Class.</t>

          <t>Provide a way for co-operating domains to reconcile between
          independently administered extended community namespaces, and
          interoperate between different transport signaling protocols in each
          domain.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In this document we focus mainly on MPLS LSPs as transport tunnels,
      but the mechanisms would work in similar manner for non-MPLS transport
      tunnels too, provided the tunnel can carry MPLS payload.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Transport Class">
      <t>A Transport Class is defined as a set of transport tunnels that share
      certain characteristics useful for underlay selection.</t>

      <t>On the wire, a transport class is represented as the Transport Class
      RT, which is a regular Route-Target extended community.</t>

      <t>A Transport Class is configured at SN and BN, along with attributes
      like RD and Route-Target. Creation of a Transport Class instantiates the
      associated Transport RIB and a Transport routing instance to contain
      them all.</t>

      <t>The operator may configure a BN to classify a tunnel into an
      appropriate Transport Class, which causes the tunnel's ingress routes to
      be installed in the corresponding Transport RIB. These tunnel routes may
      then be advertised into BGP.</t>

      <t>Alternatively, a router receiving the transport routes in BGP with
      appropriate signaling information can associate those ingress routes to
      the appropriate Transport Class. E.g. for Transport-VPN family(SAFI 75)
      routes, the Transport Class RT indicates the Transport Class. For BGP-LU
      family(SAFI 4) routes, import policy based on Communities or inter-AS
      source-peer may be used to place the route in the desired Transport
      Class.</t>

      <t>When the ingress route is received via [BGP-SRTE], which encodes the
      Transport Class as an integer "Color" in the NLRI as "Color:Endpoint",
      the Color can be mapped to a Transport Class during import processing.
      The Color could map to a Community, or Route-Target that installs the
      ingress route for "Endpoint" in the appropriate Transport RIB. The
      BGP-SRTE route when advertised out to BGP speakers will then be
      advertised in Transport-VPN family with Transport Class RT and a new
      label. The MPLS swap route thus installed for the new label will pop the
      label and deliver decapsulated-traffic into the path determined by SRTE
      route.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Transport RIB">
      <t>A Transport RIB is a routing-only RIB that is not installed in
      forwarding path. However, the routes in this RIB are used to resolve
      reachability of overlay routes' PNH. Transport RIB is created when the
      Transport Class it represents is configured.</t>

      <t>Overlay routes that want to use a specific Transport Class confine
      the scope of nexthop resolution to the set of routes contained in the
      corresponding Transport RIB. This Transport RIB is the "Routing Table"
      referred in [Section 9.1.2.1 RFC4271]</t>

      <t>Routes in a Transport RIB are exported out in 'Transport-VPN' address
      family.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Transport Routing Instance">
      <t>A BGP VPN routing instance that is a container for the Transport
      RIBs. It imports, and exports routes in this RIB with Transport Class
      RT. Tunnel destination addresses in this routing instance's context come
      from the "provider namespace". This is different from user VRFs for
      e.g., which contain prefixes in "customer namespace"</t>

      <t>The Transport Routing instance uses the RD and RT configured for the
      Transport Class.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Nexthop Resolution Scheme">
      <t>An implementation may provide an option for the service route to
      resolve over less preferred Transport Classes, should the resolution
      over preferred, or "primary" Transport Class fail. To accomplish this,
      the set of service routes may be associated with a user-configured
      "resolution scheme", which consists of the primary Transport Class, and
      an ordered list of fallback Transport Classes. The resolution-scheme may
      also be specified in terms of ordered list of Transport-RIBs</t>

      <t>A community may be used to map to a "resolution scheme", thus called
      as "Mapping Community".</t>

      <t>A service route received in BGP service family can be associated with
      a resolution scheme using import policies. The import policies can match
      against "Mapping community" or a "set of attributes" on the service
      route that maps to a resolution scheme. When a route is received with
      this attribute, it signifies the resolution scheme to use when resolving
      the route's PNH.</t>

      <t>A transport route received in BGP Transport-VPN family should use a
      resolution scheme that contains only the primary Transport Class without
      any fallback. The primary Transport Class will be identified by the
      Transport Class RT carried on the route.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="BGP Transport-VPN Family NLRI">
      <t>The Transport-VPN family will use the existing AFI of IPv4 or IPv6,
      and a new SAFI "Transport-VPN" that will apply to both IPv4 and
      IPv6.</t>

      <t>The NLRI encoding is exactly the same as RFC-4364 (AFI/SAFI = 1/128
      or 2/128) as stated in Fig 1.</t>

          Figure 1: Transport-VPN NLRI

- Length:

    The Length field consists of a single octet.  It specifies the
    length in bits of the remainder of the NLRI field.

    Note that the length will always be the sum of 20 (number of bits
    in Label field), plus 3 (number of bits in Rsrv field), plus 1
    (number of bits in S field), plus the length in bits of the
    prefix.

    In an MP_REACH_NLRI attribute whose SAFI is TBD, the prefix will
    be 96 bits or less if the AFI is 1 and will be 192 bits or less
    if the AFI is 2.

    As specified in [RFC4760], the actual length of the NLRI field
    will be the number of bits specified in the Length field, 
    rounded up to the nearest integral number of octets.

- Label:

    The Label field is a 20-bit field containing an MPLS label value
    (see [RFC3032]).

- Rsrv:

    This 3-bit field SHOULD be set to zero on transmission and MUST
    be ignored on reception.

- S:

    This 1-bit field MUST be set to one on transmission and MUST be
    ignored on reception.</artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>Attributes on a Transport-VPN route include the Route-Target extended
      community, which is used to leak the route into the right Transport RIBs
      on SNs and BNs in the network.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Comparison with other families using RFC-8277 encoding">
      <t>SAFI 128 (InetVpn) is a RFC-8277 encoded family that carries service
      prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes come from the customer
      namespaces, and are contexualized into separate user virtual service
      RIBs called VRFs, using RFC-4364 procedures.</t>

      <t>SAFI 4 (BGP-LU) is a RFC-8277 encoded family that carries transport
      prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes come from the provider
      namespace.</t>

      <t>SAFI 75 (Transport-VPN) is a RFC-8277 encoded family that carries
      transport prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes come from the
      provider namespace, but are contexualized into separate Transport RIBs,
      using RFC-4364 procedures.</t>

      <t>It is worth noting that SAFI 128 has been used to carry transport
      prefixes in "L3VPN Inter-AS Carrier's carrier" scenario, where
      BGP-LU/LDP prefixes in CsC VRF are advertised in SAFI 128 to the
      remote-end baby carrier.</t>

      <t>In this document we use a new AFI/SAFI instead of re-using SAFI 128
      to carry these transport-routes, because it is operationally
      advantageous to keep transport and service prefixes separate, and not
      mix in same address-family or rib. E.g. it allows to safely enable
      per-prefix-label allocation for Transport-VPN prefixes while not
      affecting SAFI 128 service-prefixes which have huge-scale. Also,
      re-advertisement path of transport-family routes in a network would be
      different than service-route readvertisement path. viz. Service-routes
      are exchanged over a EBGP multihop session between Autonomous-systems
      with nexthop unchanged; where-as Transport-VPN routes are readvertised
      over EBGP single-hop sessions with nexthop-self rewrite over inter-AS
      links.</t>

      <t>The Transport-VPN family is similar in vein to BGP-LU, in that it
      carries transport prefixes. The only difference is, it also carries in
      Route Target an indication of which Transport Class the transport prefix
      belongs to, and uses RD to disambiguate multiple instances of the same
      transport prefix in a BGP Update.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Protocol Procedures">
      <t>This section summarizes the procedures followed by various nodes
      speaking Transport-VPN family</t>

      <t>Preparing the network for deploying Transport-VPNs</t>

      <t><list>
          <t>Operator decides on the Transport Classes that exist in the
          network, and allocates a Route-Target to identify each Transport
          Class.</t>

          <t>Operator configures Transport Classes on the SNs and BNs in the
          network with unique Route-Distinguishers and Route-Targets.</t>

          <t>Implementations may provide automatic generation and assignment
          of RD, RT values for a transport routing instance; they should also
          provide a way to manually override the automatic mechanism, in order
          to deal with any conflicts that may arise with existing RD, RT
          values in the network.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Origination of Transport-VPN route:</t>

      <t><list>
          <t>At the ingress node of the tunnel's egress domain, the tunneling
          protocols install routes in the Transport RIB associated with the
          Transport Class the tunnel belongs to. The ingress node then
          advertises this tunnel route into BGP as a Transport-VPN route with
          NLRI RD:TunnelEndpoint, attaching a Route-Target that identifies the
          Transport Class.</t>

          <t>Alternatively, the egress node of the tunnel i.e. the tunnel
          endpoint can originate the BGP Transport-VPN route, with NLRI
          RD:TunnelEndpoint and PNH TunnelEndpoint, which will resolve over
          the tunnel route at the ingress node. When the tunnel is up, the
          Transport-VPN route will become usable and get re-advertised.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Ingress node receiving Transport-VPN route<list>
          <t>On receiving a BGP Transport-VPN route with a PNH that is not
          directly connected, e.g. an IBGP-route, the Route-Target on the
          route indicates which Transport Class this route belongs to. The
          routes in the associated Transport RIB are used to resolve the
          received PNH. If there does not exist a route in the Transport RIB
          for the PNH, the Transport-VPN route is considered unusable, and
          MUST not be re-advertised further.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Border node readvertising Transport-VPN route with nexthop self:<list>
          <t>The BN allocates an MPLS label to advertise upstream in
          Transport-VPN NLRI. The BN also installs an MPLS swap-route for that
          label that swaps the incoming label with a label received from the
          downstream BGP speaker, or pops the incoming label. And then pushes
          received traffic to the transport tunnel or direct interface that
          the Transport-VPN route's PNH resolved over.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Border node receiving Transport-VPN route on EBGP :<list>
          <t>If the route is received with PNH that is known to be directly
          connected, e.g. EBGP single-hop peering address, the directly
          connected interface is checked for MPLS forwarding capability. No
          other nexthop resolution process is performed, as the inter-AS link
          can be used for any Transport Class.</t>

          <t>If the inter-AS links should honor Transport Class, then the BN
          should follow procedures of an Ingress node described above, and
          perform nexthop resolution process. The interface routes should be
          installed in the Transport RIB belonging to the associated Transport
          Class.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Avoiding path-hiding through Route Reflectors<list>
          <t>When multiple BNs exist that advertise a RDn:PEn prefix to RRs,
          the RRs may hide all but one of the BNs, unless [ADDPATH] is used
          for the Transport-VPN family. This is similar to L3VPN option-B
          scenarios. Hence [ADDPATH] should be used for Transport-VPN family,
          to avoid path-hiding through RRs.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Ingress node receiving service route with mapping community<list>
          <t>Service routes received with mapping community resolve using
          Transport RIBs determined by the resolution scheme. If the
          resolution process does not find an usable Transport-VPN route or
          tunnel route in any of the Transport RIBs, the service route MUST be
          considered unusable for forwarding purpose.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Coordinating between domains using different community
      namespaces.<list>
          <t>Domains not agreeing on RT, RD, Mapping-community values because
          of independently administered community namespaces may deploy
          mechanisms to map and rewrite the Route-target values on domain
          boundaries, using per ASBR import policies. This is no different
          than any other BGP VPN family. Mechanisms employed in inter-AS VPN
          deployments may be used with the Transport-VPN family also.</t>

          <t>Though RD can also be rewritten on domain boundaries, deploying
          unique RDs is strongly recommended, because it helps in trouble
          shooting by uniquely identifying originator of a route, and avoids
          path-hiding.</t>

      <t>New BGP SAFI code for "Transport-VPN". Value 75.</t>

      <t>This will be used to create new AFI,SAFI pairs for IPv4, IPv6
      Transport-Vpn families. viz:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>"Inet, Transport-Vpn". AFI/SAFI = "1/75" for carrying IPv4
          Transport-VPN prefixes.</t>

          <t>"Inet6, Transport-Vpn". AFI/SAFI = "2/75" for carrying IPv6
          Transport-VPN prefixes.</t>
